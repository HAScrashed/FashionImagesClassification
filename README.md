## Fashion images classification to specific categories based on clothing images.
This project uses Multi Layer Perceptron Neural Network for image classification. It tests and compares performance of the model based on various parameters like usage of PCA reduction, numbers of layers and number of features. Tests come with additional plots and understandings.     
Results and all described details are in Jupyter Notebooks starting from AboutTheProject.ipynb.    
Databased used for learning comes from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-small](Kaggle.com).
